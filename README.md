# CIS-5270---BUSINESS-INTELLIGENCE-Python-Project

**Project Overview**

**Introduction**

The CIS 5270 Business Intelligence Python project delves into the dynamic world of coffee chains, analyzing the Coffee Chains Dataset sourced from Kaggle. 
Originating in the early 1900s, the coffee chain industry witnessed rapid growth, intensifying competition among global players like Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, and McDonald's. 
The dataset, with 4248 rows and 20 columns, offers a comprehensive view of the industry's business operations.

**Data Set Description**

The dataset, available on Kaggle, includes essential parameters such as area code, date, market, product details, state, budget, actual sales, and expenses. 
With a total addressable market exceeding $400 billion, the dataset provides insights into market size, product lines, and profitability.

**Data Cleaning**

Data cleaning involves null value removal and standardization. Techniques include checking for null values, standardizing date formats, splitting date components, and converting text to title case. 
A 'Cleaned_Coffee.csv' file is generated for subsequent analysis.

**Summary Statistics**

In-depth statistical analysis includes summary statistics for key columns such as Profit, Sales, Margin, and Total Expenses. 
These statistics aid in understanding profitability, sales distribution, and expense trends across product lines.
